# Image Classification using Deep Learning
Created an image classification algorithm using a deep neural network.
NN uses the PyTorch Deep Learning Framework. It was trained on the CIFAR-10 database
for the following objects: Airplane, Automobile, Deer, and Dog

## Database
CIFAR-10: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

## Setup

install python3 on a linux machine or VM

	>> python3 pip install -r requirements.txt



## How to Run

	>> python3 main.py
